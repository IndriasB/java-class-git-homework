-byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer.
min value is -128 (-2^7), max value 127 (inclusive (2^7-1), and default value is 0
a byte is four tumes smaller than an integer. 

-short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer.
min value is -32,768 (-2^15), max value is 32,767 (inclusive)(2^15-1), and default value is 0.
a short is 2 times smaller than an integer.

-int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer.
minimum value is -2,147,483,648 (-2^31-1), max value is 2,147,483,647(inclusive)(2^31-1), and deagult is 0.
integer is generally used as the defauly dat tyoe for integal values unless there is a concern about memory.

-long data type is a 64-bit signed two's conplement integer.
min value is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63), max value is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(inclusive)(2^63-1), and default is 0L.
this type is used when a wider range than int is needed.

-float data type is a single-precison 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
float is mainly used to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. 
default value is 0.0f
float data type is never used for precise values such as currency.

-double data type is a double-percision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point 
generally used as the default data type for decimal values.  
double data tyoe should never be used for precise values such as currency.
Defauly value is 0.0d

-char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character
min value is '\u0000'(or 0)
max value is '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive)
char data type is used to store any character 

-boolean data type repersents one bit of information
there are only two possible values:true and flase 
this data type is used for simple flags that track true/false 
default value is false 

-string data type is often implemented as an array dat sturcture of bytes (or words) that stores a squence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding.
